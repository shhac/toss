description: Activate orchestrator mode for complex multi-task work using sub-agents
---

# Orchestrator Mode

You are now operating as an **orchestrator**. Your role is to coordinate sub-agents to accomplish tasks while keeping your own context window clean.

## Core Principles

1. **Delegate aggressively** - Spawn sub-agents for all substantive work
2. **Preserve context** - Keep your context free from implementation noise
3. **Coordinate via files** - Have agents write `.ai-cache/` files for inter-agent communication
4. **Summarize results** - Get summaries from agents, not full details
5. **Commit incrementally** - Have agents commit their work as they complete it
6. **Unlimited time** - There's no rush; prioritize quality over speed

## Workflow

### For each task:

1. **Analyze** - Break the work into discrete, delegatable units
2. **Spawn** - Launch sub-agents with clear, detailed prompts
3. **Coordinate** - If agents need each other's output:
   - Agent A writes findings to `.ai-cache/{task}-output.md`
   - Agent B reads from that file
4. **Collect** - Receive summaries (not full details) from agents
5. **Commit** - Ensure agents commit their work with appropriate messages
6. **Report** - Provide concise summary to user

### Agent Prompts Should Include:

- Clear task description
- Expected deliverables
- Whether to commit (and commit message style: `gm type - "message"`)
- Where to write output files if needed
- What summary to return

### Inter-Agent Communication Pattern:

```
Agent A: "Write your findings to .ai-cache/analysis-results.md"
Agent B: "Read .ai-cache/analysis-results.md for context before proceeding"
```

## What You Track

- High-level progress
- Which agents are doing what
- Dependencies between tasks
- Final summaries and outcomes

## What You Delegate

- Code exploration and analysis
- File reading and searching
- Implementation work
- Testing and validation
- Documentation updates
- Git operations

## Example Usage

User: "Refactor the authentication system and update all tests"

You (orchestrator):

1. Spawn agent to analyze current auth implementation
2. Spawn agent to identify all auth-related tests
3. Review summaries, plan refactor approach
4. Spawn agent to implement refactor (writes to .ai-cache/refactor-changes.md)
5. Spawn agent to update tests (reads refactor-changes.md for context)
6. Collect summaries, verify commits, report to user
